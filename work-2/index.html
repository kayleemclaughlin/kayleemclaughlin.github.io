    <h2>Work in Progress 2</h2>
    <p>As we have progressed through the semester I have constantly been learning. I am starting to feel more comfortable making changes on my GitHub page, whereas, last reflection, I was scared to in fear of messing everything up. Just as I was getting comfortable with GitHub, we switched over to Photoshop, another platform I had very limited knowledge about. At first I was overwhelmed by the amount of tools, settings, and options that were available. It looked like there was a lot for me to learn, and very limited time to do so. </p>
    <p>To start I browsed through the different tools and played around with them on photos to see what I was able to accomplish. I changed the hue, saturation, and brightness, however, made no major changes to my photo. Determined to learn, I paid attention in class and followed along on the LinkedIn learning activities and was able to expand my knowledge and skill set to make edits as I tackled our first assignment. The first day we were assigned our “expectations” assignment, I made very minimal progress and focused mainly on what it was that I wanted to portray and how I was going to accomplish that. I chose to use the Crest Ad that says “Give your kids a fighting chance” and focused my time on eliminating the toothpaste and adding sunscreen instead. I did this to change the overall meaning of the ad and use it to advertise a new product. I was impressed with my final outcome of the project. One of the major challenges I faced was because the toothpaste tube and sunscreen tube I chose were completely different shapes. Luckily, I was able to use layers, the lasso tool, the eraser tool, and many others to make the sunscreen tube fit right into the hand on the ad.  </p>
    <p>Our next assignment was the Genre Remix Assignment. This was definitely my most complicated assignment for a variety of reasons. For one, this was intended to be a group work assignment, however, the day it was assigned I was unfortunately sick and unable to make it to class. To make up the work, I completed this project on my own. My goal for this assignment was to turn the movie from horror to buddy comedy. I thought this would be an interesting plot change because it is typically known as being very dark and scary, whereas buddy comedies are typically the opposite. Prior to spring break, I made a small amount of progress in class using Photoshop. I was able to eliminate the creepy clown hand in the background, as well as, the little boy in the yellow coat. I cropped in two individuals on bicycles and my goal was to have them look like they were catching a balloon together. I eliminated the clown face in the balloon and brightened the colors to a hot pink rather than a dark red to lighten the mood. After spring break my intent was to brighten the photo and do a better job merging the background with the bike, particularly the wheel spindles. However, the corona virus came along and put a damper in those plans. I had already used my free trial of Photoshop for the Storyboard Assignment so I was unable to download it again on my computer. I downloaded GIMP and attempted to make my final touches using that. I was unable to get the background to be as light as I wanted, however, if given more time in the future that is definitely something I would look to do. </p>
    <p>For my storyboard assignment I chose to use my PechaKucha topic, 5 Hat Racks, and explain what it was in a comical way. My storyboard shows 2 individuals contemplating different ways to organize their hats. They display 5 different ways (location, alphabetically, chronological, category, and size) to resemble the 5 different ‘hat racks’ explained in the design principle. At the end of the storyboard assignment the individuals come to the realization that the most efficient way to organize their hats is by using a combination of organizational techniques. This assignment used a TON of layering and cropping. Each hat and figure were on their own layer (until I merged) and strategically placed. Overall, I think my assignment explains the 5 Hat Racks in an efficient manner and the storyboard itself came out very well. If I were to add anything to this assignment I would potentially add dialogue bubbles around what the individuals are saying. The reason why I did not do this in the first place is because I did not want the individual boxes to be overwhelmed with too much detail. </p>
    <p>Our last Photoshop assignment was designing a logo. I was very happy with the way my logo turned out. My goal was to create a coffee shop logo that would appeal to individuals at the beach. I understand that when people are at the beach they likely want to relax rather than do work. However, sometimes duty calls and the work must be done. I wanted this logo to be warm and welcoming but still give off the “vibe” of beachy relaxation. I chose to use a cursive font style to resemble waves and going with the flow. The Ombre fill of blues was set to represent the blue skies and water color. The circle around the mug represent that my coffee shop will be open from sunrise to sunset as just as the sun has moved around the mug. </p>
    <p>Thus far I believe I have made most of the edits and design concept changes that I had planned on. I am very impressed with how far I have come, especially with GitHub. I was able to put together a checklist under that tab and design it how I had intended it to look. Moving forward I aim to make more edits, specifically on my genre remix assignment and hopefully add more CSS design elements to my GitHub page.  </p>
