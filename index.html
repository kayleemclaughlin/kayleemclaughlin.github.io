    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Kaylee McLaughlin and I am currently a senior at the University of Pittsburgh. I will be graduating in April with a bachelor degree in health services and a minor in economics. I am originally from the alleged “Central Jersey”, and yes, I am constantly engaged in the pork roll vs. Taylor ham argument (team pork roll!). You will likely find me spending time with my family and friends, traveling, or trying new foods. I am at my happiest when I am lying on the beach trying to convince people that country music isn’t as bad as they may think. Thank you for taking the time to visit my site and I hope you enjoy browsing through the rest of it.</p>
