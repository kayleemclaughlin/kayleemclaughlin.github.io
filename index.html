    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Kaylee McLaughlin and I am currently a senior at the University of Pittsburgh. I will be graduating in April with a bachelor degree in health services and a minor in economics. Upon graduation (that has been postponed) I will be moving to Philadelphia to work as a business development associate at InstaMed. I am originally from the alleged “Central Jersey”. You will likely find me spending time with my family and friends, traveling, or trying new foods. I am at my happiest when I am lying on the beach trying to convince people that country music isn’t as bad as they may think. This site will include a variety of different assignments that I have completed throughout the course of the semester. Thank you for taking the time to visit my site and I hope you enjoy browsing through the rest of it.</p>
