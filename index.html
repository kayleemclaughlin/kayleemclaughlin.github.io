    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Kaylee McLaughlin and I am currently a senior at the University of Pittsburgh. I will be graduating in April with a bachelor degree in health services and a minor in economics. I am originally from the alleged “Central Jersey”, and yes, I am constantly engaged in the pork roll vs. Taylor ham argument (team pork roll!). My family consists of my mom, dad, older brother, and dog. </p>
      
    <p>In my spare time I enjoy traveling, in fact, last spring I had the amazing opportunity to study abroad in Florence, Italy for the entire semester. Living in such an amazing city with beautiful art all around me was truly an incredible experience. I was fortunate enough to be able to travel to 10 countries and 18 cities during that time. I will use this blog to share with you all some of my favorite restaurants and activities that are must do’s while traveling in Europe. My biggest piece of advice for you is to step outside of your comfort zone and be adventurous. Take advantage of your opportunities and try new things! You will never know if you like/dislike something if you never give it a try!</p>
