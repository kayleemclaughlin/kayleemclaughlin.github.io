    <p>I had such an amazing time with my family renting Rick's apartment. It was in a great location close to down town and near the train station making for easy travel. This luxurious house resembled an exact jail cell, the kids loved it. It reminded them of the time they were able to visit Uncle Brock in prison. It was so nice of Rick to share his special house with complete strangers that he knew nothing about. I’m sure nothing could possibly go wrong when doing that. I felt very secured the whole time because there was a smart lock that tons of people before me also used the same code for. Oh, and the comfort of this apartment was unbelievable. I need to know where Rick got this rock-hard mattress from. I will definitely be replacing my one at home with whatever that one was. This gorgeous private suite was everything and more from what I had imagined. I will be sure to use Airbnb again, especially Rick’s apartments.</p>
