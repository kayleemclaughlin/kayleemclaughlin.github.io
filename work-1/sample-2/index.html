    <h2>Work in Progress 1</h2>
    <p>The inspiration of my website design is going to be that of a beach coffee shop. I want it to be simple yet professional, as it will be portraying school work. However, I do not my website to be overwhelmed with words and fluff. When I think of a beach coffee shop, I think of it as a place to go to grab a cup of coffee thatâ€™s very peaceful and calming. I would like to incorporate a blue green template with maybe some touches of browns or tan to break it up.</p>  
    <p>I would like there to be a title bar on every page so that it is a simple task to go from one page to another, just as going with the flow is on island time. As for the fonts, I would like to use a very smooth and elegant font, potentially a cursive. The curves in the cursive font can slightly resemble waves calmly rolling in the distance. I would like my website to be general symmetrical because when I think of symmetry I think of it as being more visibly appealing to the eye, just as the beach is. I would like there to be a thin banner along both sides of the menu bar. In addition, I would like some of my menu items to have drop down menus. Overall, I would like my website to have a very clean and calming feel.</p>
    <p> The photos below will serve as inspiration for my website. Although I have very little coding experience, I am not sure how attainable this design will be, however, I am willing to give it a try!</p>
