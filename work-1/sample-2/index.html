    <h2>Work in Progress 1</h2>
    <p>For my website I will be designing I would like it to be easy to navigate, aesthetically pleasing, and simple. I would like there to be a title bar on every page so that it is a simple task to go from one page to another. I also would like to use majority neutral colors and include photos where necessary. I am thinking I will create a “travel” website based off of places I traveled during my semester abroad. I will include an about me page and have different pages on the different locations I went to. On each of the location pages I will include ideas of where to eat, what to see, and things to do. </p>  
<p>My intended audience would be other study abroad students because I am able to relate to them the most. The vision of my website is for it to look something like the attached images below. I am not sure how easy that will be for me to complete because I have very limited coding experience but I am willing to give it a try! The title font on the Lily website would be ideal for my website. I like the simplicity of the color schemes both websites have. I do not want my webpages to have an overwhelming amount of information on them. For the most part I would like everything on my website to be centered.  </p>
