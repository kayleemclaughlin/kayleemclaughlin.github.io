    <h2>Work in Progress 1</h2>
    <p>Since freshman year I’ve been mind-blown by my roommates’ ability to do what I thought was just typing in a bunch of foreign symbols onto the computer screen and turning them into a functioning product. She would try and explain to me the basics of what she was doing but it never really resonated with me. This was my first ever exposure to the concept of coding. Walking into class the first day of this course I was a little scared that this “coding” concept would actually have to soak in my head this time.  As the professor went over the syllabus I was thinking there was absolutely no way I would be able to create a website from scratch, yet here I am, writing on that very website I created. </p>
    <p>I do have to admit I did have a bit of a rocky start. GitHub and I did not get along from the very beginning. One of our first assignments was to create our GitHub page from the instructions Matt gave us. Just when I thought I was doing as I was told, I would go to my site and absolutely nothing would be on the page. I would go back and forth making small changes to different files and ultimately making it worse by deleting words. I was instantly panicked that I was not as far as the rest of the class. It was then I realized that this process took some time to update on the actual page, at least using Safari. I was jumping to conclusions thinking my page was blank too soon. It also made me realize that, like Matt has told us multiple times that, Chrome is a “far superior” server. </p> 
    <p>Another one of our prior assignments was our design concept writing assignment. Both my original and revised assignment are posted under "Classwork Sample 2" above (My original "about me section" that went with this theme is on Box") .  I slightly misinterpreted the instructions for this one and created a design concept of a “travel website” rather than designing the course website. For my travel website at first, I explained very specific choice elements that I wanted on my page, such as having a title bar on every page, wanting to use neutral colors, and add photos where necessary. I was designing my website very blindly and based on what I thought may look aesthetically pleasing. And yes, those are all very helpful elements, but I never really had a “theme” that I wanted to accomplish. In class on February 10th, we did a brainstorming activity. Matt asked us to think of a theme, such as Cat in the Hat, and then think of design elements that went with that theme. Immediately ideas were flowing. I wanted a “goofy” letter that reminded me of being a child again; I wanted a blue, red, and white color scheme to resemble the book cover; I wanted an uneven title bar to resemble the messiness of the house that the book talked about cleaning.</p>
    <p> It was so much easier to think of a design concept that way rather than designing it blindly. After class that evening, I went back to my original design concept and rethought about it. As a person who loves the beach and spends a lot of time there during the summer, I thought about which theme would best fit me. One of the first ideas that came to my mind was the concept of a coffee shop at the beach.  In my opinion a coffee shop is a place you go to relax, talk with friends or family, or get mindless work done.  A beach to me is similar in the sense that you can go there to relax, spend time with people, or read a book. With that theme in mind, I was able to come up with design concepts that would be able to fit that. I wanted an easy to use and simple website design, resembling people who may be on “island time” at a coffee shop on the beach. The font, at least for the main header I wanted to resemble smooth waves with a smooth font. I added a white border around my menu to slightly break the pages up, just as a wave would break on the beach. In addition, I added a hover element on my menu bar so that people viewing my site are able to see which menu link they are about to select.</p>
    <p>At this point I believe I have made most of those concepts I had envisioned come to life. Moving forward, I would like to learn and add a few elements. For one, I would like to add a drop-down menu on the menu bar to make for even easier transitions. I would like to learn how to crop photos and soften the edges using Photoshop, particularly on the photo I have on my home page. I am also excited to potentially add a logo to the header of my page, just as a coffee shop would have a logo on their store front. I am eager to continue to learn and develop technical skills in this course that I can hopefully take with me as I enter the “real-world” in a few months.</p>
