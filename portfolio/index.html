    <p><i><h3>Reflection Essay</h3></i></p>
    <p>At the start of the semester I was a bit worried that I would not be successful in this course. I had limited previous experience with just about everything on the syllabus. Web design and the use of GitHub were first our first assignments, both of which were foreign to me. The first site I produced was almost identical to the bare-minimum class skelton that was given to us to help us follow along. It was a step in the right direction for me, however, I wanted to personalize my site and make revisions. I define revisions as changes made to correct or better something. </p>
    <p>The first revision I made of my site was adding color to relate to the theme I chose. The original theme I had in mind was a beach coffee shop. I thought one of the best ways to portray this was to add a variety of different blues to my site. I originally chose a light blue background with white and royal blue font. However, I realized looking back it was a difficult to read with such little contrast between the colors. I then decided to change my font to a navy blue and now I believe my site is much easier to read.</p>
    <p>Another revision I made to my site was for the viewers because I wanted my site to be simple and easy to use. I purposely displayed my menu bar across the top of the site on all pages so when looking through my website it was always known how to get back or go to a new page. To help my menu bar further stand out I revised my site to have a white border around it. In addition, I added an element that when the mouse scrolls over a link, the link changes colors. </p>
    <p>Multimodal describes the combination of multiple different ways of communicating in everyday life. My site is an example of a multimodal project for a variety of different reasons. For one, the linguistic mode refers to the use of language. The word choice of my site is very simple and it does not take a genius to figure out what is being portrayed. On each page I explain what the content is and the site as a whole comes together as a cohesive unit. The visual mode refers to the use of images and other characteristics that readers see. This can include the different shades of blues I chose to resemble the ocean, the simplistic layout, the portioned sizes of the photos included, or the centering of everything on my site. The aural mode focuses on sound. I definitely could have used more aural modes on my site, however, the soundscape activity mentioned below is a great use of aural mode. When the sound plays it is supposed to make you feel like you are sitting on a bench at the beach. Spatial mode focuses on the physical arrangement of something. The placement of my menu bar at the top of the page is an example of how I used the spatial mode for easiest access on my site. </p>
    <p>The target audience for my site was a mid-aged working individual during vacation. In my opinion a coffee shop is a place you go to relax, talk with friends or family, or get mindless work done. A beach to me is similar in the sense that you can go there to relax, spend time with people, or read a book. To have both of these concepts overlap was the goal of my site. I used relaxing colors, photographs where fitted, a simple font, and smooth navigation instructions so that my intended audience could feel at ease when breezing through my site. </p>
    <p>I feel that the pre-work and brainstorming activities were the most important components to my websites. Starting off the process of building a site I had very limited ideas in mind about an overarching goal or theme I wanted to portray. I had a difficult time going back and forth about colors, layout styles, etc. However, once I had a vision in mind of the theme I wanted to portray ideas came flying to me.  The same thing happened with all of my photoshop activities. For the logo creation, I wanted to create something that was fluid with my website but would also welcome people in to a coffee shop and I believe what I created was successful in doing so. </p>
    <p>All of my assignments in this course had some sort of edit made to them. It is often I find myself satisfied at first with the project when I complete it, however, then I go back and find mistakes or changes that I want to make. This was especially the case with my first Photoshop activity where we changed the meaning of an Ad. Because I was new to Photoshop my edits (which is in Box) were very small. I changed a few colors and duplicated a bottle of soap. I used this photo as a way to play around with the tools. Once I got comfortable with them I turned the Crest ad into a sunscreen ad. It took me hours to get the sunscreen perfectly placed in the hand of the little boy. I constantly went back to find new areas around the hand where I could eliminate excess coloring until I was satisfied with the end result. </p>
    <p>Overall, I was very satisfied with what I accomplished this semester. From having absolutely no experience with website building to creating an easily accessible and functioning website, that is something I am very proud of. I enjoyed getting feedback from both Matt and my peer review partner, Chelsea because they were able to see changes I should make that I may have not noticed without them. For example, Matt suggested to make my margins larger. I would have never guessed that a small change like that would make such a large change to my site in the way that it is viewed. My writings were much easier to read and the site overall just looked more uniform.  I definitely learned a ton from this class that I will be able to take with me post-graduation. I am excited to be able to use the skills I have gained the last few months and put them to use on my next task or challenge. </p>
